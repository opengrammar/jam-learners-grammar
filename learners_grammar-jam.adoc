== Acknowledgements

Many thanks are due to Dr. Annette Henry at the University of British Columbia for her ongoing support for this project, and for her longstanding commitment to issues in Jamaican language education.

This project also owes a great deal of gratitude to Dr. Joseph T. Farquharson of The University of the West Indies, author of the http://apics-online.info/contributions/8[Jamaican structure dataset], which formed part of the initial inspiration for this project, and from which so many of the examples in this text have been derived; as well as to the _Atlas of Pidgin and Creole Language Structures_ (APICS) Online for having the generosity and foresight to release the dataset and other works of Creole linguistics in the _Atlas_ under a Creative Commons license -- allowing them to be reused and repurposed in the way we have done here.

== Introduction

=== The Open Grammar Project

This volume is part of a series of learner's grammars by the Open Grammar Project. Like the other entries in the series, it is first and foremost an ongoing _synthesis_ of available linguistic information, which has been compiled, organized, and annotated so as to be maximally useful to *learners* rather than (just) *linguists*. It is assumed that the reader is interested in making the journey _from_ the source language _to_ the target language, and provides succinct advice on a range of relevant topics to make that journey easier. It also takes for granted that the learner is seeking to speak and write (as well as read and understand) a _living_ language of practical rather than just scholarly or historical interest.

In this task we are indebted to the source works listed in the bibliography section at the end of each volume. Many of the sources consulted are the work of linguistic experts, and those interested in learning more about the workings of a particular language are encouraged to seek out these source materials to read more deeply on the subject. The concept of a _learner grammar_ as used here, however, differs in both purpose and form from traditional linguistic grammars: it has most significantly a _didactic_ rather than simply _descriptive_ goal, and is further organized broadly under headings and topics according to the _source_ rather than _target_ grammar to make it easier for the learner to find the information they are looking for using familiar terms and categories.

There are a number of other unique features of this book. The content and source code of the book is open licensed and has been designed specifically to allow for easy machine as well as human parsing of the information within. The project is also "open" in the sense that additions, changes, corrections, and other contributions are welcome from anyone interested in improving the quality of the material.

More detailed information about the Open Grammar Project and the Learner's Grammar series can be found on the project home page:

https://opengrammar.github.io/

It is intended that this series be a complement rather than an alternative to both linguistic grammars and classroom textbooks, and it is hoped that it may serve as a useful reference for both new learners and those wishing to improve or maintain their language skills.

=== Jamaican

==== Name

The Jamaican language goes by a variety of names in different contexts: *Patwa* (_Patois_), Jamaican Patwa, Creole, Jamaican Creole, Afro-Jamaican, JamC, JC, AfroJam, or simply *Jamiekan* (_Jamaican_), with the most common among Jamaican speakers themselves being *Patwa*.

Although Jamaican is the native and first language of almost the entire population of Jamaica, it takes a number of different forms that fall along a continuum stretching from the _basilect_ (furthest distance from Standard Jamaican English) to the _acrolect_ (closest distance from Standard Jamaican English). Forms all along the middle of this continuum are common in Jamaica, while the extremes (basilectal and acrolectal forms) are relatively rare.

Following the example of most published linguistic grammars, this text will tend towards an idealized basilectal form which for simplicity's sake will be referred to as _Jamaican_.

== Writing system

=== Alphabet

The Jamaican alphabet consists of 25 letters, including one letter -- *c* -- which is sometimes (as here) considered a digraph, since it only appears in the form *ch*

* lowercase letters: *a*, *b*, *ch*, *d*, *e*, *f*, *g*, *h*, *i*, *j*, *k*, *l*, *m*, *n*, *o*, *p*, *r*, *s*, *t*, *u*, *v*, *w*, *x*, *y*, *z*
* uppercase letters: *A*, *B*, *Ch*, *D*, *E*, *F*, *G*, *H*, *I*, *J*, *K*, *L*, *M*, *N*, *O*, *P*, *R*, *S*, *T*, *U*, *V*, *W*, *X*, *Y*, *Z*

=== Special Characters

Jamaican in the orthography presented here (based on the Cassidy-JLU System) does not require any special characters or diacritics to write.

=== Punctuation

==== Basic punctuation

Punctuation in Jamaican generally follows the same conventions as Standard Jamaican English and UK English more generally

Some writers may use an apostrophe to separate two words that should be read together

* *no av* -> *na'av* (_not have_)

Sometimes an apostrophe may be used to indicate sound change when two words are merged

* *du it* -> *dwi'it* (_do it_)

It may also be used to avoid difficult to pronounce strings of letters in the merged word

* *gi iin* -> *gi'iin* (_give in_)

== Morphology

=== Nouns

==== Basic Form of Nouns

==== Plural of nouns

To form the plural of a given _definite_ noun, use the article *di* and add the plural marker *-dem* to the end of the word

* *di pikni-dem*, _the children_
* *di nieba-dem*, _the neighbours_
* *di buk-dem*, _the books_
* *di pus-dem*, _the cats_
* *di daag-dem*, _the dogs_
* *di pat-dem*, _the pots_
* *di man-dem*, _the men_
* *di uman-dem*, _the women_
* *di bwai-dem*, _the boys_
* *di piipl-dem*, _the people_
* *di faama-dem*, _the farmers_
* *di hat-dem*, _the hats_
* *mi iez-dem*, _my ears_

It is not necessary to add the plural marker *-dem* if it follows a cardinal number

* *di faiv buk*, _the five books_

If the plural noun is _indefinite_ it is also not necessary to use the *-dem* marker

* *Buk de pan di tiebl*, _Books are on the table_
* *Mango swiit*, _Mangoes are sweet_
* *Im a sel yam a maakit*, _He is selling yams in the market_

Examples of using plural nouns:

* *Di pikni-dem laas di piepa*, _The children lost the paper_
* *Di buk-dem de pan di tiebl*, _The books are on the table_
* *Di pus-dem av nof pikni*, _The cats have many kittens_
* *Ruoz tel im se a Klaris mash di pat-dem*, _Rose told her that it was Claris that broke the pots_
* *Di man-dem dig di uol ahn di uman-dem plaant di kaan*, _The men dug the holes and the women planted the corn_
* *Si yu buk-dem ya*, _Here are your books_

NOTE: Many linguists have noted that *-dem* is not strictly speaking a plural marker: plural nouns (for example, indefinite nouns and inanimate objects) can be expressed without it, and there are several restrictions on its use. Generally speaking, it is used more often for human beings than for animals, and more often for animals than for inanimate objects.
(For more details, see Stewart, 2011.)

===== Plural Reduplication

In rare cases it is possible to create a plural noun by repeating it:

* *buk-buk* _(several) books_

NOTE: However this can only be used with mono-syllabic nouns and only when referring to groups of more than two

In other cases, a reduplicated noun can indicate affection or intimacy:

* *gal-gal*, _daughter (affectionate appellation)_


===== Associative Plural

If the plural suffix *-dem* is attached to the end of a proper name, it means _(person named) and the others_

* *Jan-dem*, _John and the others_

Examples:

* *Ruoz-dem tel im se a Klaris mash di pat*, _Rose and the others told her that it was Claris that broke the pot_

==== Measure Words

==== Case

===== Nominative Case


===== Accusative Case

===== Genitive Case

Use the pattern *x y* to express a possessive relationship between two nouns, such as _the x of y_ or the _the x's y_

* *di nieba-dem ous*, _the neighbours' house_
* *Mieri son*, _Mary's son_
* *Piita daata*, _Peter's daughter_
* *Maak buk*, _Mark's book_
* *Sanja bag*, _Sandra's bag_
* *Sanja buk ahn Piita bag de pan di grong*, _Sandra's book and Peter's bag are on the floor_

==== Proper Nouns

===== Personal Names

Given names (also known as *Kristiyan niem*, _Christian names_) follow the same rules of phonology as other words (including loan words) in Jamaican. So _George_ becomes *Jaaj* (pronounced /dʒa:dʒ/), Mary becomes *Mieri* (pronounced /mɪɛɹi/), and so on.

It is important to note that in many social contexts, nicknames may be used in preference to given names (see <<nicknames,Nicknames>> and <<yard-names,Yard Names>> below).

====== Female Names

* *Darati* /daɹati/, _Dorothy_

===== Nicknames

In practice, many people may be only rarely referred to by their given name. A rich system of nickaming exists in Jamaican and nicknames are frequently based on characteristics or appearance rather than the given name of the person in question.

These nicknames are also known as *yaad niem* (_yard names_), and are generally used by friends, family, and others for most purposes other than formal occasions (such as by teachers in school, or accessing government or other institutional services).

Impromptu nicknames may also be given to strangers, for example, when calling out to someone on the street if their name is not known. Like yard names, these are generally based on easily recognizable physical characteristics and other descriptors such as occupation.

====== Yard Names

The vast majority of yard names are descriptive or have some sort of story that explains their origin. However, occasionally, a yard name may be based on the actual given name of the person concerned. For example, "Nicholas" or "Nick" might be known as:

* *Neki* ("Necky")
* *Niki* ("Nicky")
* *Niko* ("Nico")

Similarly, someone whose name begins with the letter _V_ might be known as:

* *Vii* ("Vee")

The two principles (descriptor and element based on given name) can also be combined:

* *Likl Dii* ("Little D", e.g. a person of short stature whose given name begins with the letter "D")
* *Hevi Dii* ("Heavy D",  e.g. a large person whose given name begins with the letter "D")

Sometimes yard names are otherwise completely conventional names that nevertheless have nothing to do with the person's given name:

* *Alisha* ("Alicia", given name e.g. _Kelly_)
* *Anji* ("Angie", given name e.g. _Celia_)
* *Chrisha* ("Tricia", given name e.g. _Louise_)
* *Chrudi* ("Trudy", given name e.g. _Sandra_)
* *Doreen* ("Doreen", given name e.g. _Mary_)
* *Pachrik* ("Patrick", given name e.g. _Mark_)
* *Tam* ("Tom", given name e.g. _James_)
* *Tuoni* ("Tony", given name e.g. _Edward_)

====== Identifiers

The prefix *Mis* or *Misiz* is often added to some other name or characteristic to make a female yard name:

* *Miss Opie*
* *Miss Vyel*
* *Misiz Steps* ("Mrs. Steps")

NOTE: In combination with a surname, *Mis* and *Misiz* can also be used to form an honorific address (see further below).

Names can be based on work:

* *Tiich* ("Teach")
* *Tiicha* ("Teacher")
* *Nars* ("Nurse")

For merchants or employees of particular stores, apart from general occupational descriptions, yard names may be based on the specific product they sell:

* *Kriimi* ("Creamy", someone who sells icecream)
* *Notsi* ("Nutsy", someone who sells nuts)
* *Juusi* ("Juicy", sells juice)

A male merchant may often be referred to as "_product_-man" depending on what they sell:

* *Manggo-man* ("Mango-man", a man who sells mangoes)
* *Gliina-man* ("Gleaner-man", a man who sells the _The Gleaner_ newspaper)
* *Juus-man* ("Juice-man", a man who sells juice)

On the other hand, the yard name may be based on the place where the product is sold:

* *Shaka* ("Shakka", works at a juice shack)

From the above it can be seen that someone who sells juice might have any of the following yard names:

* *Juicy* (male or female)
* *Juice-man* (male only)
* *Shakka* (male or female)


===== Honorifics

There are several standard honorific titles which are used in Jamaican, either independently, or in combination with a surname:

* *Mista*, _Mr._
* *Mis*, _Miss_
* *Misiz*, _Mrs._
* *Ma*, _Ma'am_
* *Sa*, _Sir_
* *Mas*, _Master_

The following are some respectful forms of address for women:

* *Empress*
* *Princess*
* *Baby*
* *Mommy*
* *Aunty*
* *Miss*

The following are some respectful forms of address for men:

* *Boss*
* *Bossman*
* *Bossy*
* *Bredren*
* *General*
* *Prince*
* *Sar*
* *Uncle*

Formal introductions usually involve a greeting (e.g., *Gud maaning*, *Gud aftanuun*, *Gud iivning*) plus an honorific title (*Mista*, *Mis*, *Misiz*) and the person's surname:

* *Gud maanin, Mista Jansn*, _Good morning, Mr. Johnson_
* *Gud aftanuun, Mis Yuuz*, _Good afternoon, Miss Hughes_
* *Gud iivning, Misiz Juonz*, _Good evening, Mrs. Jones_

Children usually refer to adults who are not relatives or friends as *Sa*, *Mista*, or *Mis*.

Respected family member or elders may be referred to using the honorific title *Maas* (_Master_) followed by their given name:

* *Maas Aizak* (_Master Isaac_)

==== Pronouns

===== Personal Pronouns

There are six basic personal pronouns in Jamaican: *mi*, *yu*, *im*, *wi*, *unu*, *dem*

* *mi*, _I_ (first person singular)
* *yu*, _you_ (second person singular)
* *im* / *ihn*, _he / she_ (third person singular)
** also: *shi* / *ar*, _she_
** also: *i* / *it*, _it_
* *wi*, _we_ (first person plural)
* *unu*, _you_ (second person plural)
* *dem* / *dehn*, _they_ (third person plural)

In some cases, the subject pronouns *im* and *dem* can be pronounced *ihn* and *dehn*

* *Ihn tel lai pahn mi*, _He told a lie about me_
* *Dehn a go iit aaf aal di raip plom ahn gwaava af di chrii*, _They are going to eat up all the ripe plums and guavas from the tree_

No special conjugation is needed when using different personal pronouns in a sentence

* *Mi nuo di man*, _I know the man_
* *Im nuo di man*, _He knows the man_
* *Yu nuo di man*, _You know the man_
* *Dem nuo di man*, _They know the man_

There are no gender distinctions in personal pronouns in the Jamaican acrolect

* *Im gi im im*, _She gave it to him_

However in the mesolect, there is a distinction between *im* (_he_) and *shi* (_she_)

* *Im a di liida*, _He is the leader_
* *Shi a di liida*, _She is the leader_

There is also frequently a distinction between *im* (_he_) and *i* (_it_)

* *I hebi kyaan-don*, _It is extremely heavy_

The pronoun *wi* (_we_) can mean _we_ as in including the speaker and the listener, or as the speaker and others (not including the listener)

* *Wi de go a Tong*, _We are going to town_
* *Wi nuo di man*, _We know the man_
* *Wi ahn Mieri kech liet*, _We and Mary arrived late_

===== Object pronouns

Object pronouns are the same as subject pronouns in Jamaican

* *Dem kaal mi fi kohn elp dem*, _They asked me to help them_
* *Im a laaf afta wi*, _He is laughing at us_

===== Possessive pronouns

* *mi*, _my_
* *yu*, _your_
* *im*, _his_
* *shi*, _her_
* *wi*, _our_
* *unu*, _your (pl.)_

=== Adjectives

Adjectives in Jamaican are not marked for gender or number. In other words, they do not change depending on the gender of the noun they describe, or whether the noun is plural or singular.

==== Order of Adjectives and Nouns

Adjectives precede the nouns they describe, as in English

* *taal ier*, _long hair_

==== Comparison of Adjectives

===== Degree Words

* *tuu*, _too_

===== Superlatives

The superlative form of adjectives is created by adding the suffix *-is* to the end of the word

Superlatives can also be formed using *di muos* + A

=== Sentences

==== Word Order

Basic Jamaican sentences are S-V-O, that is to say, they follow the order _subject-verb-object_

* *Mangguus nyam foul*, _Mongooses eat chickens_

The subject, verb, and object may take the form of phrases rather than a single word, but the basic sentence order is the same

* *Di man chrech out im an*, _The man stretched out his hand_

In the example above, *di man* is the subject of the sentence, *chrech out* is the verb (verb phrase) or action that the subject is performing, and *im an* is the object, or recipient of the action

==== Parts of a sentence

(In progress)

===== Subject

(In progress)

===== Copula

The copula *a* (_is_) is always used when equating two nouns or noun phrases

* *Jan a obya-man*, _John is a ritual specialist_
* *Mi a sia-man*, _I am a seer_

However, the copula is never used to connect nouns and adjectives

* *Di rich man miin*, _The rich man is stingy_

In the above example, the noun phrase "rich man" and the adjective "miin" are connected without needing to use *a*

Use of the copula with prepositions is variable -- some prepositions need it and others do not

* *Yu shuda ina di ous*, _You should have been in the house_
* *Dem wehn ina di bos*, _They were in the bus_

*de* -> copula + locative

* *Di shot we yu waahn ina ous*, _The shirt which you want is inside the house_
* *Di shot we yu waahn de ina ous*, _The shirt which you want is inside the house_
* *Juoziv de (ina) Mie Pen*, _Joseph is in May Pen_
