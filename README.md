## About the series

This volume is part of a series of learner's grammars by the Open Grammar Project. Like the other entries in the series, it is first and foremost an ongoing _synthesis_ of available linguistic information, which has been compiled, organized, and annotated so as to be maximally useful to **learners** rather than (just) **linguists**. It provides succinct advice on a range of relevant topics to make the language learning journey easier. It also takes for granted that the learner is seeking to speak and write (as well as read and understand) a _living_ language of practical rather than just scholarly interest.

There are a number of other unique features of this book. The content and source code of the book is open licensed and has been designed specifically to allow for easy machine as well as human parsing of the information within. The project is also "open" in the sense that additions, changes, corrections, and other contributions are welcome from anyone interested in improving the quality of the material.
